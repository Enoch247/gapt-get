A stop gap solution to using apt-get when you donâ€™t have an internet connection handy. Gapt-get is different from similar tools, because it does not require you to install or have any admin privlages on the internet connected machine. This is handy if your "internet" machine is a public machine at a library or a machine that is administered by an uncooperative IT department.

TO USE: (from gapt-help)

using wget on internet machine...
1.) gapt-get update/upgrade/install [pkgname] > get.sh
2.) ./get.sh (in an empty dir on internet connected machine)
3.) gapt-unzip (run in dir downloads are saved in)
4.) gapt-cp (run in dir downloads are saved in)
5.) apt-get upgrade/install [pkgname]

using a web browser on internet machine...
1.) gapt-html update/upgrade/install [pkgname] > get.html
2.) download links in get.html (save to empty dir)
(note: make sure and save them as the name of the link, the browser may try to save them as the wrong name)
3.) gapt-unzip (run in dir downloads are saved in)
4.) gapt-cp (run in dir downloads are saved in)
5.) apt-get upgrade/install [pkgname]
