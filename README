A stop gap solution to using apt-get when you donâ€™t have an internet connection handy.

if you have any machine connected to the internet with a browser installed, use as follows to install a package from the repo:

1.) gapt-html install PKGNAME > get.html
2.) on internet connected machine open html file in browser and download all links (make sure and save them as the name of the link, the browser will try to save them as the wrong name)

if you have a linux machine connected to the internet with wget installed, use as follows to install a package from the repo:

1.) gapt-get install PKGNAME > get.sh
2.) ./get.sh (in an empty dir on internet connected machine)
3.) gapt-unzip (run in dir downloads are saved in)
4.) gapt-cp (run in dir downloads are saved in)
5.) apt-get install PKGNAME

instructions are the same for apt-get update and apt-get upgrade just without PKGNAME (obviously)
